## Setup

For install the project run `npm install` or `yarn` for get all the dependences.

## Run

`npm run start` or `yarn start` for run the dev server with the application at the port **3001**

`npm run api` or `yarn api` for run the api server at the port **3000**, if you don't run that fake server you won't get any data for reviews.

## Build

`npm run build` or `yarn build` create a production ready bundle for use un static servers. Remember edit `webpack.config.js` the `productionPath` variable if your server is in other path.
